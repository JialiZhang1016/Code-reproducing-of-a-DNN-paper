# DNN

The programming environment is tensorflow2.0 + python3.7.

"mnist on MLP.py" is the original py-file of "MLP-3.py".

I plot the "accuracy" and "loss" images in "plot_mnist on MLP.py". This py-file is programmed based on "mnist on MLP.py".


## 2020/3/10 update

I uploaded 3 py-files and 2 png-files.

py-1 "opt_loop.py"  
py-2 "bs_loop.py"   
py-3 "opt+bs_loop.py"  

png-1 "Train-Test Accuracy (3-opt,3-bs, 1-lr).png"  
png-2 'Train-Test Loss (3-opt,3-bs, 1-lr).png' 


## 2020/3/13 update

I uploaded 1 py-file and 1 png-file. (solved the problem of legend by creating the list to store the names and results)

bs+lr_loop.py  
Training Loss_lr=[0.01,0.001,0.005] bs=[64.128,256].png
