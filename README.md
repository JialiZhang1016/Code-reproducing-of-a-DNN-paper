# DNN

The programming environment is tensorflow2.0 + python3.7.

"mnist on MLP.py" is the original py-file of "MLP-3.py".

I plot the "accuracy" and "loss" images in "plot_mnist on MLP.py". This py-file is programmed based on "mnist on MLP.py".


# 2020/3/10 update

I upload 3 py-files and 2 png-files.

py-1 "opt_loop.py"  
py-2 "bs_loop.py" 
py-3 "opt+bs_loop.py"

png-1 "Train-Test Accuracy (3-opt,3-bs, 1-lr).png" 
png-2 'Train-Test Loss (3-opt,3-bs, 1-lr).png'
